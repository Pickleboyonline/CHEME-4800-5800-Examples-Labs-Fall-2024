# Lab 9d: Linear Programming and the Assignment Problem
An alien landed in my office, walked over to my desk, and touched my face with its strange, bulbous, glowing finger. When I woke up, I found myself in a strange room with a strange computer. The computer had a strange program running on it.
I copied the program and the data it was using. 

### Tasks
The program was a linear programming solver. It appears to solve the problem set 3 (PS3) assignment problem. Analyze the alien program and its associated data to determine how the program works and the properties of the optimal solution.
