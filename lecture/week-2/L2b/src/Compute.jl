    function find(students::Array{MyStudentModel,1}; sid::Int64=0, netid::String="abc123") -> Union{Int64, Nothing}

The function `find` searches for a student in an array of students. The function takes in an array of `MyStudentModel` objects and two optional parameters: `sid` and `netid`. 
The function returns the index of the student in the array if the student is found, otherwise it returns `nothing`.

## Arguments
- `students::Array{MyStudentModel,1}`: an array of `MyStudentModel` objects.
- `sid::Int64=0`: the student ID of the student to search for. Default is `0`.
- `netid::String="abc123"`: the net ID of the student to search for. Default is `"abc123"`.
